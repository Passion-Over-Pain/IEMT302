## Module Overview

**Emerging Technologies (IEMT302)** examines selected, current advances in computing and their broader impact. Throughout the semester I will:

- Investigate an emerging technology’s background and current use.  
- Compare it with earlier solutions or paradigms.  
- Prototype or experiment with key technical aspects.  
- Propose a hypothetical system that incorporates the technology.  
- Analyse ethical and societal implications.

All related artefacts—code, notes, drafts, and final deliverables—are tracked in this repository under the folders listed in the Table of Contents.

## Assessment Breakdown

This module follows a continuous assessment structure. All work is completed and submitted during the semester. Below is a breakdown of the assessment components and their corresponding weights:

| Component             | Weight  | Notes                                |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Topic 1 Submission   | 10%     | Based on first emerging tech topic   |
| Topic 2 Submission   | 10%     |                                      |
| Topic 3 Submission   | 10%     |                                      |
| Topic 4 Submission   | 10%     |                                      |
| Draft Submissions    | 10%     | Initial versions of final report     |
| Presentation         | 10%     | 12-minute summary of final findings  |
| Final Report         | 40%     | Approx. 5,000-word research report   |
| **Total**            | **100%**|                                      |

Each submission will be stored in the relevant folder within this repository.


## Technologies Explored

This section includes topic-based work and research on each emerging technology covered in the module. Each folder contains practical exercises, notes, and submissions related to that specific topic.

- [Natural Language Processing](Technologies/NLP/)
- [Blockchain](Technologies/Blockchain/)
- [Smart Contracts](Technologies/SmartContracts/)
- [Quantum Computing](Technologies/QuantumComputing/)
- [Extended Reality (AR-VR)](Technologies/ExtendedReality/)



## Practical Exercises

This folder contains implementation-based tasks and experiments related to each technology explored during the module. These include code, setup notes, and outcomes from hands-on sessions.

All exercises are organised by topic and aligned with the weekly practicals.

## Quizzes and Tutorials

This section contains responses to quizzes, structured tutorials, and guided walkthroughs completed throughout the semester. Each entry corresponds to a weekly topic or practical component.

- Folder: [Quizzes/](Quizzes/)


## Report Development

This folder tracks the progress of my final research report, including early drafts, outlines, feedback responses, and the final submission.

- Folder: [FinalReport/](FinalReport/)


## Presentation Material

This section contains materials related to the final 12-minute presentation, including slides, notes, and any supporting media or visuals used during the presentation.

- Folder: [Presentations/](Presentations/)

## Ethical and Societal Considerations

This section includes reflections on the potential ethical, societal, and environmental impacts of the emerging technologies explored throughout the course. It addresses the broader implications of these technologies on individuals and society.
