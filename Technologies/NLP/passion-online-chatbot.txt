1. Since I couldn't do the telegram portion of this exercise, I decided to use my own chatbot, Passion
2. This chatbot was built prior to this course, in my own ventures but should still get the job done
3. NLP is a fascinating concept, one I might consider for the Final Report 
4. The chatbot, Passion, is built on OpenAI's GPT-4 - works well with the WISH, Verbs, Sentence Type Handling etc
5. As you can see, the code uses nodes, each node resembles a user's current point in the conversation
6. It looks messy but it works :) - Programmers
7. Passion is can also be integrated on Telegram - but I don't have an account once again
